# Phase 3 - Implementation and Testing

**Submission Deadline: 28th Marh 2023**

**Submission Guidance**: You will submit to [turnitin](https://moodlecurrent.gre.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2165634) the **hash** of the final commit for the project, `phase\3` will be merged into `main` once you have finished developing and testing.

## Structure of the Implementation and Testing Phase Report

You will need to produce a **markdown** documentation in the form of a report that details the requirements phase of the project.

- ensure that once the project is cloned to your local machine that you checkout to `'phase/3'` and branch off of this to your own branch using the following standard: `'phase/3-gitusername'`. As part of your workflow, you will merge back into `'phase/3'` **ONLY**. 
.
- **Do not** merge to `main`

Working as a team you will assign each other tasks to complete phase 3, refer to the required sections for the `README.md` file below.

The implementation and Testing Phase  `README.md` should include the following information:

- **A table indicating** - the allocation of tasks to team members

- **Implementation section** -  The programming language you should use is C#. In this section, you have to explain which the main classes and methods are and what their purpose is.  You do not need to explain what every single method does – just the core methods and the ones with a more complex logic.  Make sure you follow your design when you implement the classes and methods chosen.

- **Testing section** -  Explain what kind of testing strategies you have used and why you did choose these strategies.  Make sure you test the program thoroughly.  Specify what tests you have run and the results you got, e.g. has the system passed the test or not.  Use a tabular format.  Include also screen shots of the actual tests’ execution. 

> **Important Note:**
>> - Each member of the team should contribute to both implementation and testing. 
>> - Final submission you must merger `phase/3` into `main`
