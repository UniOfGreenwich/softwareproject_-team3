## Structure of the Requirements Phase Report

You will need to produce a **markdown** documentation in the form of a report that details the requirements phase of the project.

- ensure that once the project is cloned to your local machine that you checkout to `'phase/1'` and branch off of this to your own branch using the following standard... `'phase/1-gitusername'`. As part of your workflow, you will merge back into `'phase/1'` **ONLY**. 

- **Do not** merge to `main`.

Working as a team you will assign each other tasks to complete phase 1, refer to the required sections for the `README.md` file below.

The requirements phase `README.md` should include the following information:

- **Introduction** – it briefly describes the need for the system and its functions.
- **Table** - indicating the allocation of tasks to team members
- **Software Process Model** - detailed outline of the software process model you have chosen for the project and reasons for your choice
- **Glossary** - this should define any technical terms used. Do not make assumptions about the expertise of the reader.
- **User requirements definition** should describe services provided for the user in simple natural language.
- **System requirements specification** should describe the functional and non-functional requirements in detail.
- **Possible risks and risk planning**
- **References and Acknowledgements** – should contain the references you have used following the Harvard referencing system (http://www.citethisforme.com/harvard-referencing) and some acknowledgments thanking people / organisations who might have helped you preparing the report.
- **A Gantt chart of the project plan** – using [Mermaid Gantt Chart Template](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpdUD1rwzAQ_SvHzTZYbiZtAdNOntKloOWwrqlILRXlPISQ_55TpRDaQ6DT--Chd8UleUaLR4oiLoKOBPlm2MNbgWAKdMy0VsqT8GvKKwnAh04_z_00Ve7Mi4QU4VDvCu5B6HyC51gyHYyD2fWD0dPBy-CbNCb54vw0WPoUfZMBKBb_N6bJK_hePCEWssU8IsxY3GZsbvofAhbGnccOV9ZvBa9VXIvUoepWdmh19ZRPDl28qY42SYdLXNBK3rjD7aeU0lp6gOyDpDzXan8bvt0BQFBqnQ) at the end of the README.md file under a section called Appendix to be included in the Appendix.
- **Kanban** - In this section you wil add a link to the Kanban
 
> **Notes:** 
>> - **Gantt Chart** - When preparing the Gantt chart, bear in mind the following deadlines specified below.  Your Gantt chart at this stage should be a first version of the Gantt chart for your project, providing details for the project phase 1 only and just specifying phase 2 and 3 by titles but not providing any more details at that stage. You will be submitting updated Gantt charts including the details about phases 2 and 3 at a later stage in the project development.
>> - **Kanban** use the Github Project feature to create a Kanban for this software engineering project. Ensure you fill out all cards completely with assignees, tags, descriptions and due dates.
