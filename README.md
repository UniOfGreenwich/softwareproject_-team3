## Introduction

The final phase for the project involves the implementation and testing of the product. The overall design of the code was done based on the requirements of the previous phases, as well as the final product brief. Individual elements of the project were then split up to be completed by indivudual team members.

## Implementation

The implementation for the project involved splitting it up into smaller elements to make it more managable.

## Testing

Testing of individual elements had to be done to make sure that they work as intended.

### Working elements

- The login page worked as intended
- Editing the account information modifies the database as intended
- The logout button closed the account window

### Non functioning elements

- Some of the buttons in the home page did not function properly
- The database for the books as well as some of the functionality to borrow did not function well
